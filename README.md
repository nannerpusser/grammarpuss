### Some word game tools. Best, most complete python Wordament Solver on GitHub, if I do say so myself. 

This is actually a total rework of a previous version, which implemented a very dogshit OCR for grabbing the digrams automatically. I call this version the Fuck OCR Edition. 

Limited depends, but you will need customtkinter and pywinstyles. Only runs on Windows 10/11, with full GUI effects only available in Windows 11. 

pipenv install, requires python 3.10+
